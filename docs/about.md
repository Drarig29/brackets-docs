All these libraries were initially created for the [Nantarena](https://nantarena.net/), a LAN party organized by a French school, in which I was a CS:GO server admin.

We wanted to move away from the public - and not open source - solution we were using to manage the tournaments.

We finally didn't take the step, but I still enjoy this project and the (small) popularity it's starting to have.

Don't mind to file an issue or start a discussion in the relevant GitHub repo! :smile:
