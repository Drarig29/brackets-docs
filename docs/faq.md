# FAQ

## Why do I need a `tournamentId`?

Because you can have multiple stages per tournament.

For instance, you have:

- A round-robin stage (32 participants)
- A high-tier double elimination stage (16 best participants)
- A mid-tier double elimination stage (the rest of the participants)

And thanks to that, the participants in the database can be linked to a specific tournament.
